#Red or black game.


##Object of the Game


User has gotten 100 virtual coins on his account.

Then he makes an optional bet from 1 to 10 coins.

After, he starts the game trying to gess out between two colors (red or black).

This colors generates randomly and showing on the screen.

If the user selected a correct color his bet doubles and he can gess out again or takes couns back to his account.

If wrong he loses his bet and makes another one until he is run out of money.

Every time when user gesses out correctly, he doubles his money but no more that 8 times.

After 8 time win user "wins the pyramid" and sees the shape of pyramid on the screen. 

So if he bets 1 coin he wins ((((((((1*2)*2)*2)*2)*2)*2)*2)*2 = 256 coins.
